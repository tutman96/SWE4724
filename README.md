# SWE4724 - Capstone Project
## AMOMS Alternative Medicine Office Management System - [https://amoms.tuttle.tech](https://amoms.tuttle.tech)
The objective of the AMOMS project is to develop an application that will run on the offic's intranet and will assist the employees of the medical group with management of all processes related to patients.

### To get started
- Install NodeJS from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). The LTS version is fine
- Clone this repo
- Run `npm run update` to install the packages
- Run `npm run build` to build the TypeScript into Javascript
- Run `npm start` to start the server
- Point your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to load the page

### To develop
- Download and install Visual Studio Code from [http://code.visualstudio.com/](http://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Open this repo in Visual Studio Code
- The views are located in the `views/` folder, the rest of the source (models and controllers) are in the `source/` folder
- After making modifications to the TypeScript, you have to transpile it to Javascript. To do this, press `Cmd + Shift + B` (on MacOS) or `Ctrl + Shift + B` (on Windows/Linux)
- You can run the code in the integrated debugger by pressing `F5`. After you transpile the TypeScript, you must restart the application
- Once your changes are made, push them to the `develop` branch and open a Pull Request to merge them into the `master` branch
- The code will (eventually) auto-deploy on a successful merge into `master`
